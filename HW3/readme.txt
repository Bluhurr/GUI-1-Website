Everything seems to be working properly with the css styling,
apart from one aspect. That aspect is that the bulleted list
does not indent when placed underneath the image as it does
pdf description and example images. Due to the way that I
positioned the navbar and image, I cannot add a margin on the
left side, which would most likely cause that indenting effect.
Otherwise everything seems to be working as it should.
